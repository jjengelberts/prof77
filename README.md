# Professional Programmer's Guide to Fortran77

As a PhD student, I was a big fan of the "Professional Programmer's Guide to Fortran77": it taught me the language I needed to extend the Valence Bond program TURTLE, now a module in [GAMESS-UK](http://www.cfs.dl.ac.uk/), used in our group at the time. When I recently had to look into Fortran77 again, I found out that the source code of the book was made available by the author [Dr. Clive Page](https://www.star.le.ac.uk/~cgp/fortran.html), since it is now (long) out of print.

Although his [PDF](http://www.star.le.ac.uk/~cgp/prof77.pdf) is available, as well, I like to be able to compile the book "from scratch" myself. Doing so, I found out that the current version of *pdflatex* creates horrible red boxes around items in the table of contents. Therefore, I decided to copy the files from [Dr. Page's homepage](https://www.star.le.ac.uk/~cgp/) and update the TeX file. Additionally, I updated the PDF metadata fields to correctly show author, title, subject and keywords in a PDF reader.

Many, many thanks to the author Dr. Clive G. Page!
