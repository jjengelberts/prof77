# Professional Programmer's Guide to Fortran77

As a PhD student, I was a big fan of the **Professional Programmer's Guide to Fortran77**: it taught me the language I needed to extend the Valence Bond program TURTLE, now a module in [GAMESS-UK](https://computingforscience.com/docs/html/turtle/index.html), used in our group at the time. When I recently had to look into Fortran77 again, I found out that the source code of the book was made available by the author [Dr. Clive Page](https://www.star.le.ac.uk/~cgp/fortran.html) under the GNU Free Documentation Licence.

Although his [PDF](http://www.star.le.ac.uk/~cgp/prof77.pdf) is available, as well, I prefer to compile the book myself. Doing so, I found out that the more recent verions of *pdflatex* (TeX Live) run into compilation errors and/or produce PDF files of inferior quality. Therefore, I decided to copy the source file from [Dr. Page's homepage](https://www.star.le.ac.uk/~cgp/) and update it. From now on, I will maintain the source file in such a way that *pdflatex* will create a good looking PDF.

Many, many thanks to the author Dr. Clive G. Page!
