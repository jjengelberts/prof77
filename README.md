# Professional Programmer's Guide to Fortran77

As a PhD student, I was a big fan of the **Professional Programmer's Guide to Fortran77**. This book taught me the language I needed to extend the Valence Bond program TURTLE, now a module in [GAMESS-UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAMESS_(UK)), used in our group at the time.

Back in 2019, I had to look into Fortran77 again. Searching for my favorite book, I found out that the source code of it was made available by the author Dr. Clive Page under the GNU Free Documentation Licence. I downloaded it and modified it in such a way that a high quality PDF file could be created using *pdflatex*.

In the meantime, the website that hosted the source file of Dr. Page at the university of Leicester is no longer available. Therefore, I decided to maintain the source file of his book in such a way that *pdflatex* will create a good looking PDF from it.

Many, many thanks to the author Dr. Clive G. Page!
